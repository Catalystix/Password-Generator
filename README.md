# JavaScript Password Generator

* Challenge week 3- We were given starter code this week to finish building a password generator with confirmation. 
We had to include the variables of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters so that the user could pick what they wanted in their password. 
This was brutal for me, I understand the idea and what we are trying to accomplish its putting the pieces together that have been the hard part. Mostly renaming variables to be
equal to a new one.
